# Injustice Clicky Game
This is a memory app created with React.  The application uses components This weeks assignment was to create a memory game with React. It required me to break up my application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events. 
​
## Getting Started: 
Start playing the game by clicking on an image. Once an image is clicked the images shuffle, continue clicking on new images to score points.  If you click on an image more than once the score resets to 0 and the highest score is saved.
